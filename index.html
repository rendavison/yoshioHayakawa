                    It is clear that one function of graphic design is to communicate messages. I believe, however, that it should not end up being just a technique and that it is important that we invite the world of graphic design, with its formative appeal consisting of color and shape, to inject elements of beauty into people’s lives.

                <p>
                    Yoshio Hayakawa, often said to embody the “traditional sprit” of Japanese graphic design, was a post-WII Japanese designer, illustrator, and commercial artist. He was born in 1917 in Osaka, Japan, and by the age of 19 he had already graduated from the Osaka Prefectural Industrial Arts School. After graduation, Hayakawa went into advertising and lived in Osaka’s cultural district. He worked as a window display artist, and later, an advertising designer, for various department stores such as Mitsukoshi and Kintetsu. From 1943–1948, Hayakawa took a five year break from working to fulfill his military service. He went on to open his own design firm in 1954 in Tokyo, lectured at the University of Arts in Kyoto, and had a full and influential career until his death in 2009. Some of his contemporaries and collaborators include Yusaku Kamekura, Kenya Hara, and Hiroshi Ohchi.

                    At first glance, Hayakawa’s work can look somewhat similar or repetitive, but he expressed his beliefs through the strong ideas backing each piece he created. A combination of consistency in style, progression in ideas, and accomplishments sums up the character of both his body of work, and his career.

                    Hayakawa earned a lot of recognition over the course of his life and career, from gaining many followers both stylistically and philosophically, such as Ikko Tanaka. He acted as a forefather to a lot of younger designers in many aspects, showing not only them, but Western designers as well, that being an accomplished, well revered designer and coming from an Eastern background did not have to be mutually exclusive. After his death, the National Museum of Art in Osaka, keeping in character with its longstanding relationship with Hayakawa since its opening in 1977, honored his legacy with a retrospective exhibition on his work.
