                    Hayakawa worked at a point some consider to be the “dawn” of Japanese design because of the kind of artistic “renaissance” happened in the country post-WWII, as Western influence and a restructured Japanese society contributed to the field’s exponential growth. Many of Hayakawa’s contemporaries were embracing Western influence. Advertisers, commercial artists, and designers were creating work with concepts clearly borrowed from Europe, some combining Japanese and Roman characters, others adjusting their color palettes to be less earthy and subdued, and some, on the more extreme end, created designs more similar to Swiss modernist design than any traditional Japanese style.

                    However, Hayakawa reacted to the rising Western influence by not only embracing, but highlighting traditional Japanese styles in both his advertising and illustrative work. Much of his work uses thick brushstrokes and large solid lines, as well as features more minimalist human forms drawn in an exaggerated style. In fact, Hayakawa’s human elements tend to be more conceptual and symbolic than strictly communicational or representative.

                    His use of color is flat and varied, with some work painted with less saturated color while others feature a much brighter palette. However, even with these pieces the style is distinctly organic and the imagery so deliberately Japanese. The elements of Western design and art that Hayakawa incorporated into his work was secondary to his overarching Eastern style.

                    Despite his focus on Japanese stylistic elements and imagery, Hayakawa broke ground in Western circles. After World War II, the United States and Europe had strained ties with Japan. Hayakawa was one of the first Japanese designers to be introduced to these Western societies while world relationships were still strained. He was also the first Japanese member of the Alliance Graphique Internationale, a global organization for graphic artists and designers, started and based in Europe. Though Hayakawa’s international recognition never resulted in international awards, he won many Japanese awards over the course of his career, such as the Bronze and Silver Medals from the Art Directors Club of Tokyo, the Book Design Award from the Ministry of Industry and Culture in Tokyo, and the Culture Award from the Kodansha Publishing Company.
