                    While Hayakawa received Western praise throughout his career, he still primarily focused on personal work and collaborative projects to help rebuild Japan. The country was heavily feeling the affects of World War II even decades after its surrender. In 1951 he lent a hand in establishing the Japanese Advertising Artists Club, an organization that helped build the importance of Japanese graphic and advertising design as Japan’s economy came back in the fifties. The organization drew attention to both the necessity of design as Japan came into the second half of the twentieth century, and worked to get it on the Japanese media’s radar as the economy progressed.

                    In 1970 Hayakawa was on the planning committee for a Japanese exhibition at Expo ’70, which was a world’s fair held in Osaka, with the theme of “Progress and Harmony for Mankind” and an emphasis on looking towards the future. It was Japan’s first world’s fair, and featured displays of technological innovation, scientific accomplishments, and art. In part, Expo ’70 reflected Japan’s changing attitudes since World War II, as well as its efforts to rebuild after the devastation of the forties.

                    Following the trend of promoting a more peaceful future for not only Japan but also the world, Hayakawa was one of the collaborators involved in a poster project titled “Hiroshima Appeals.” Functioning as a joint effort between the Japan Graphic Designers Association Inc. (led at the time by president Yusaku Kamekura, who also designed the first poster) and the Hiroshima International Cultural Foundation, the project sought to use the tragedy of the nuclear bombings on Hiroshima and Nagasaki as a jumping off point for discussion. Starting in 1983, a member of the JAGDA was chosen to design and release one poster a year until 1991, when the project was temporarily disbanded until 2005. Its main purpose was to promote peace both at home in Japan and abroad, and also help continue the conversation on the future of nuclear weapons that was on the forefront of many world leaders’ minds. Hayakawa designed the 1986 poster, featuring a vague, shadowy figure reaching out towards a dove.

                    Aside from his many projects, Hayakawa was a full-time lecturer at the University of Fine Arts in Kyoto for 17 years between 1953 and 1970. He was also a part time lecturer at the University of Fine Arts in his hometown of Osaka starting in 1964. From this position, he not only helped shape the minds of Japan’s future artists and designers, but also continued to provide an alternative to fully Westernizing Japan’s artistic world.
